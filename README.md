## Get started
(1)Secured add , update and delete todo task with expo local authentication module.
(2) Toaster message implementation from react native root toast module.
(3) No change in the screen if the user decides to cancel the authentication and lands back to the previous screen.
(4) Unless the user inputs any letter the add todo task button is disable.
(5) If a user tries to edit a todo task and then removes all the letters from the todo input then on update that particular todolist will be             deleted.
(6) Test cases are written for very basic functionality , not to overkill.
